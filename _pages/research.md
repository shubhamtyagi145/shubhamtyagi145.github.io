## Electron Transport and Quantum Effects

My research uses DFT–NEGF methods to study electron transport
in low-dimensional and molecular-scale systems, with emphasis
on coherent transport and transmission mechanisms.

## Phonon Transport and Thermal Phenomena

I investigate phonon transport in heterostructures and
superlattices, focusing on interface effects and thermal
resistance using atomistic transport methods.

## Memristive Devices and Nonequilibrium Processes

Current work explores current-induced forces, Joule heating,
and switching mechanisms in two-dimensional memristive systems.

## Machine Learning for Atomistic Modelling

Machine learning approaches are used to accelerate atomistic
simulations and enable multiscale modelling of transport processes.

Electronic structure → Transport → Thermal dynamics → ML acceleration

### Electron Transport and Quantum Effects

My research uses DFT–NEGF methods to study electron transport
in low-dimensional and molecular-scale systems, with emphasis
on coherent transport and transmission mechanisms. This was my major research area during my PhD.

### Phonon Transport and Thermal Phenomena

I investigate phonon transport in heterostructures and
superlattices, focusing on interface effects and thermal
resistance using atomistic transport methods. This work is the main focus of my [(https://www.nqs-group.com/post/anr-project-coconut-2025-2028)). 

### Multiscale Modelling of Transport Processes

With Phonon transport, I am also exploring ways of connecting DFT → transport → atomistic dynamics for a better understanding of atomic effects.

### Machine Learning for Atomistic Modelling

Machine learning approaches are used to accelerate atomistic
simulations and enable multiscale modelling of transport processes. It is one of the main pillars of the [COCONUT](https://www.nqs-group.com/post/anr-project-coconut-2025-2028) I am involved with.

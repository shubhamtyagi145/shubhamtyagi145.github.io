Welcome to my website! I am a postdoctoral fellow in the [Nanodevice Quantum Simulation group](https://www.nqs-group.com), under the guidance of Prof. Marc Bescond. I did my PhD from the [Computational Physics & Materials Science Lab](https://cpms.kaust.edu.sa) at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology under the supervision of Prof. Udo Schwingenschlögl. 

What do/did I do?
======
I am a computational materials researcher (postdoctoral fellow) working on charge and heat transport in nanoscale devices. My research focuses on understanding nonequilibrium phenomena at the atomic scale using first-principles simulations and atomistic modelling.

My work combines density functional theory (DFT), nonequilibrium Green’s function (NEGF) methods, and atomistic simulations to investigate electron and phonon transport, energy dissipation, and current-driven effects in nanoscale systems. A central objective of my research is to understand how atomic structure, interfaces, and dimensionality govern transport processes and ultimately determine device performance.

Current research focuses on thermal transport and thermal management in heterogeneous materials and low-dimensional materials, particularly through phonon transport in interfaces, heterostructures, and superlattices. More broadly, I am interested in multiscale approaches that bridge electronic structure methods, transport theory, and data-driven models to enable predictive simulations of functional materials and devices.

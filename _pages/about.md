Welcome to my website! I am a postdoctoral fellow in the [Nanodevice Quantum Simulation group](https://www.nqs-group.com), under the guidance of Prof. Marc Bescond. I did my PhD from the [Computational Physics & Materials Science Lab](https://cpms.kaust.edu.sa) at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology under the supervision of Prof. Udo Schwingenschlögl. 

What do/did I do?
======
I am a computational materials researcher working on charge and heat transport in low-dimensional materials and nanoscale devices. My research focuses on understanding nonequilibrium phenomena using first-principles simulations and atomistic modelling.
My work combines density functional theory (DFT), nonequilibrium Green’s function (NEGF) methods, and atomistic simulations to study electron and phonon transport, current-induced effects, and thermal dissipation in nanoscale systems.

Current research directions include memristive devices based on two-dimensional materials, phonon transport in heterostructures and superlattices, and multiscale modelling approaches that integrate machine learning with physics-based simulations.
